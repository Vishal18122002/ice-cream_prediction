You own an ice cream business and you would like to create a model that could predict the daily revenue in dollars based on the outside air temperature (degC). You decided to build a simple Artificial Neural Network to solve this problem.  

Data set:
  - Input (X): Outside Air Temperature
  - Output (Y): Overall daily revenue generated in dollars 

This example is a regression example, we will cover regression in more details in future projects.
